Welcome to my blog! The countdown has officially begun, and I could not be more excited to start Hack Reactor next week. 

My previous two blogs were about concert-going and working for a social-environmental NGO in Brazil, so the times are a changing. Huge thank you to Jonathan McGlone for his helpful guide on putting together this site. If you're strugling to set up github with Jekyll, highly recommend this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"> guide</a>.
